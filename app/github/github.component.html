<h2>Forms</h2>

<p> As users enter form data, we capture their changes and update an instance of a model. We can't layout the form until we know what the model looks like. A model can be as simple as a "property bag" that holds facts about a thing of application importance. That describes well our Hero class with its three required fields (id, name, power) and one optional field (alterEgo). </p>
